# ideas

This is a public place in which I will put ideas that people are likely to try and patent but may not have yet.

I know nothing about patent law, but my hope is that these public notes may constitute prior art. 

I think the whole patent idea is stupid - it acts to slow inovation more than accelerate it because it introduces
overhead on things that people are going to do anyway, most of the time.

## Augmented Reality 

There are many obvious uses for augmented reality technology that I suspect people will patent extensively.

This is a new technology which I expect will ultimately work very well and provide strong benefits. I expect
the things people will inevitably successfully patent around the base technology will mostly be obvious to
anyone in the relevant fields.

### industrial applications.

Think about walking around an industrial site and having interactive visualizations of data from 
scada / historians projected on or near the corresponding equipment. Or what about 3D augmented reality
animated instructions right at the equipment? want to know how to operate something - have a hologram
or probably just as good, and augmented reality 3D cursor) show you right at the equipment.

## Virtual Reality

Probably too late for this as VR is getting pretty old idea..  but training people in operation of 
equipment away from the equipment in a safer location is the most obvious thing that springs to
mind here.
